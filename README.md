# Devcomm-task
Devcomm ML task submission by Siddh Jain

In this notebook, I have fist analysed the data and converted non-numerical features to numerical using Label Encoder.
I have then generated synthetic data using SMOTE to fix class imbalance and then using Standard Scaler, I have normalised the data.
Then I have used feature selection methods - Recursive Feature Elimination and Feature Selection using Correlation Matrix to select 6 most important features.
After this some EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to analyse distribution of features and performed Bivariate Analysis.

Finally, I have built the model and trained it. And performed a comparison of the precision and F1 scores obtained.
